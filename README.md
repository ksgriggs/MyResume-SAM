# MyResume-SAM

This builds the backend for my resume [website](https://griggs-aws.com).

My website uses a counter to track visits.  This SAM template
builds the API gateway, Lambda function and DynamoDB needed to
implement it.

This was created for the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev).
